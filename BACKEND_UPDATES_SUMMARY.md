# 🎉 Backend Updates Summary

## ✅ Recently Implemented Features

### 1. Teacher Self-Assignment to Classes
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/classes/:id/assign-teacher`
- Teachers can assign/unassign themselves to/from classes
- Security: Teachers can only modify their own assignments
- Documentation: `TEACHER_ASSIGNMENT_FEATURE.md`

### 2. Teacher Unassignment Fix
**Issue**: Validation error when unassigning teachers

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/notifications/:id/respond` (also supports PUT)
- Teachers can respond to absence requests from receptionists
- Request: `{ approved: boolean, responseMessage?: string }`

## 🔄 Recent Fixes

### JWT Token Enhancement
- **Before**: `{ id: userId }`
- **After**: `{ id: userId, role: userRole }`
- **Impact**: Authorization middleware now works correctly

### Class Model
- **Before**: `teacher` field required
- **After**: `teacher` field optional (default: null)
- **Impact**: Classes can exist without teachers, unassignment works

### Notification Response
- **Before**: Expected `status: "approved"|"rejected"`
- **After**: Accepts `approved: true|false` (frontend-friendly)
- **Impact**: Frontend can send boolean instead of status string

### Route Ordering
- **Before**: Generic `/:id` route before specific routes
- **After**: Specific routes (e.g., `/:id/assign-teacher`) before generic
- **Impact**: Correct route handlers match requests
